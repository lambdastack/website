# LambdaStack Documentation

> PostgresSQL DB is being upgraded to 14.4.

In this project, the Docsy theme is included as a Git submodule:

```bash
$ git submodule
...<hash>... themes/docsy (remotes/origin/HEAD)
```

If you would like to contribute to the LamabdaStack documentation then please fork the project, create a new feature branch, push back to GitHub and then issue a PR.

If you need more details on the Docsy theme for Hugo then you can find detailed theme instructions in the [Docsy user guide][].

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS`

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our [Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```

## Troubleshooting

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```
➜ hugo server

INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 Using config file: 
Building sites … INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 syncing static files to /
Built in 288 ms
Error: Error building site: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): resource "scss/scss/main.scss_9fadf33d895a46083cdd64396b57ef68" not found in file cache
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See our [user guide](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/) for instructions on how to install Hugo.
