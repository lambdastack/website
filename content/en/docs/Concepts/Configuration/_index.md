Different configuration options for LambaStack. There is a `minimal` and a `full` option when calling `lambdastack init...`. Inside the `/schema` directory at the LambdaStack Github repo is where ALL yml configurations are managed. They are broken down into Cloud providers and on-premise (`any`).

The following are the breakdowns:
* Any - On-premise or those cloud providers not mentioned below like Oracle as an example
* AWS - Amazon Web Services
* Azure - Microsoft Azure
* Common - Anything common among the providers
* GCP - Google Cloud Platform
