## FAQ

>Is there a fee for LambdaStack?  **A)** No. It is open source with the Apache 2 license

>Is LambdaStack a custom Kubernetes repo?  **A)** No. It uses standard Kubernetes (latest version) and automates it

>Does LambdaStack do any Industrial hardening?  **A)** Yes. LambdaStack is a fork of project that we started in 2018 called Epiphany. It has been in production since 2018 with some of the most critical infrastructure in the Energy sector

>What does LambdaStack do? **A)** LambdaStack automates the deployment of Kubernetes in a true Multi-cloud configuration for AWS, Azure, On-Premise, and GCP (soon). It allows you to build out scalable infrastructures built with Kubernetes in an IaaS or PaaS version (it can use the cloud vendor's Kubernetes managed service too)

>What was the original goal of LambdaStack? **A)** The initial goal was to automate and simplify the deployment of Kubernetes so that DevOps teams could easily manage it. It grew into a platform to help developers not have to concern themselves with Kubernetes infrastructure nor the plumbing that it requires to build a true Microservice architecture. Basically, allow developers to focus on building awesome apps

>Why did you fork your original project, Epiphany? **A)** Epiphany is a good platform that is purpose built for the Energy sector. The projected path of Epiphany was to focus on the Energy market but I believed it should be more flexible and solve other industry problems. So, LambdaStack was forked and has now been changed in many ways to hit all business sectors. There are still some similarities with Epiphany (certain parts) but these are being reworked into a more hardened and flexible offering

>Does LambdaStack offer a GUI to allow DevOps (admins) to point-and-click their way to operating a Kubernetes cluster? **A)** Not currently. Kubernetes has a builtin dashboard that allows for some changes but it's mainly to view resources. Kubernetes' `kubectl` is the CLI (Command Line Interface) used by everyone that manages Kubernetes clusters. We also provide an additional CLI called `lambastack` that allows for easy standup and breakdown of Kubernetes clusters

>How can I get involved? **A)** Great question and I'm so glad you asked! See [Contributing](https://www.lambdastackio.com/docs/contribution-guidelines/). This should explain how to fork the project, create a new feature branch, push back to your forked version and issue a PR (pull request)
