<p class="lead mt-5">
LambdaStack started as a fork of the Apache-2.0 open source Epiphany project that I created in 2018. That project has been used in production in major energy firms since then. However, I believed the projected needed to be more flexible, easier to use (nice UI), work on all major cloud platforms as well as on-premise, and even more powerful automation - thus LambdaStack.

One major thing that is being added is the ability to work on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as a native Kubernetes cluster or utilize the Google managed Kubernetes platform.
